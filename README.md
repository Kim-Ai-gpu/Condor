# 🦅 Condor: Fast-Converging Neural Attention via Learnable Connection Functions

*Novel attention mechanism developed by a 15-year-old Korean researcher*

PyTorch implementation of "Condor: Neural Connection Networks for Enhanced Attention" 

**🔥 Key Result**: Achieves 8.6% better perplexity (100.86 vs 110.30) compared to standard Transformer on wikitext-2 with only 3 epochs of training.

```

## 📊 Results
| Model | Perplexity | Epochs | Speed | Notes |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Standard Transformer | 110.30 | 3 | ❌ Slow | Industry standard |
| **Neural KY-Attention** | **100.86** | **3** | ✅ **Fast** | **Korean teen innovation** 🇰🇷 |

## 🧠 The Story Behind Condor

This research emerged from curiosity about why traditional calculus uses "straight lines" to connect points. What if we could use learnable functions instead? This question led to the **Kim-Youngseong (KY) Transform** - a mathematical theory that generalizes differentiation.

*Sometimes the best insights come from questioning the fundamentals we take for granted.*

## 🔧 Architecture

Neural KY-Attention extends traditional self-attention with learnable connection functions:
- **Learnable Connection Networks**: Each attention head learns unique connection patterns
- **Linear Complexity**: O(L×W×H) instead of O(L²×H) 
- **Window-based**: Efficient local attention with global context
- **Mathematically Rigorous**: Built on solid theoretical foundations

## 🎯 Key Features

- ⚡ **Extremely fast convergence** - achieves good performance in just 3 epochs
- 🧠 **Novel mathematical foundation** - based on Kim-Youngseong (KY) Transform theory  
- 📈 **Better sample efficiency** - learns more from limited data
- 🔧 **Easy to integrate** - drop-in replacement for standard attention
- 🎓 **Student-friendly** - developed with educational clarity in mind

## 🌟 What Makes This Special?

Traditional attention mechanisms are constrained by pairwise interactions. Condor breaks free by:

1. **Replacing static patterns** with learnable connection functions
2. **Capturing multi-token relationships** simultaneously  
3. **Achieving linear complexity** without sacrificing expressiveness
4. **Learning specialized patterns** across different attention heads

*This isn't just an incremental improvement - it's a fresh perspective on how we think about attention.*
